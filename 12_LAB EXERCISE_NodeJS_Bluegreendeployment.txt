LAB EXERCISE – 12

Blue-green Deployment

TASK:
Implement a Blue-Green Deployment strategy for a Node.js application. 
The goal is to containerize the app using Docker, push it to Docker Hub, and set up a Jenkins pipeline that deploys the app in two separate environments, blue and green. The deployment should ensure zero-downtime, allowing users to continue using the application while a new version is deployed and tested.
PROCEDURE: YOU WILL SUBMIT THE PROCEDURE
